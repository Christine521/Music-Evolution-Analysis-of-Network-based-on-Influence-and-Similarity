# Music-Evolution-Analysis-of-Network-based-on-Influence-and-Similarity
Music is one of the most essential parts of the spiritual life of human society. It is also a complex
target of scientific inquiry. Directed networks are constructed and a series of algorithms are
applied, so that we can describe the characteristics and interrelation of both musicians and
genres. Most importantly, their role in promoting the music evolution is also measured.
In Task I, we first establish and visualize the directed network. Then, PageRank Algorithm
is applied to obtain PR value as a measure of the artist influence. A subnetwork is established
based on partial data, indicating that the ranking of high-impact musicians is basically unchanged
over time, but its influence decreases with time due to the enrichment of music.
In Task II, we construct a weighted undirected network in terms of Whole-Feature-Based
Similarity (WFBS) using Mahalanobis Distance. Furthermore, Infomap Algorithm based on
Huffman coding and random walk is utilized to obtain 209 communities. It can be concluded
that the same genre is not the inevitable condition of high similarity between musicians.
In Task III, we extend the influence and similarity of individual gained in Task I&II to
the overall genres. Then, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used to obtain genre
distinguishment and change trend over time. Hence, we accurately explore the merging trend
of some specific genres.
In Task IV, we respectively calculate Influence-Based Similarity (IBS) by Centralised
Cosine Measure and Single-Feature-Based Similarity (SFBS). On the basis of Kullback-
Leibler (KL) Divergence, we discover the consistency between similarity and influence of
artists. Meanwhile, speechiness, loudness, and tempo are more contagious than others.In Task V, we speculate the possible time for musical revolution (1928, 1946, 1979, and
2009) by Moving Average Method. Kernel Density Estimation is applied to obtain the main
factors that reflect the music revolution, among which valence is the most significant one. Thus,
a valence-based similarity network is constructed to identify the musicians signifying music
revolution.
In task VI, we choose a specific genre Electronic and observe how exactly the features
investigated before changed over time. Then, we describe the similarity of their tendency
by correlation coefficients and discover that features inside one genre may have a different
performance. In addition, a simple dynamic influencer detection method is developed based on
popularity of artists in a given period.
In Task VII, we point out how our work shows that cultural, social and religious changes
have influence on the music evolution. These external influences on music may lead to changes
in music evolution.
To sum up, we consider the extension and future improvement of our model. Additionally,
we analyze the strengths and weaknesses of our model.
